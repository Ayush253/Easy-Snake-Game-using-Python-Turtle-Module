# Easy-Snake-Game-using-Python-Turtle-Module

This project will show you how much easy it is to build a classic snake game using Python's Turtle module. 
It is also great way to understand the concepts of class, objects and inheritance for a beginner while coding this game. It is designed in a way that whenever snake
eats food i.e. given a turtle shape and a random color, it will increment it's length by 1 with a random color and score gets updated also by adding 1 to previous score. If the snake collides with the border or if it collides with it's own body segemnt, game is over.
The game can keep track of your highscore as well. The highscore will be retained every time you play the game.
